# Spectral Sequences Editor

I don't knot much about spectral sequences, but maybe this tool will help someone who does.

## Usage

```bash
# With NPM
npm install    # install deps
npm run dev    # for development
npm run build  # build for production

# With Bun
bun install    # install deps
bun dev        # for development
bun run build  # build for production
```
